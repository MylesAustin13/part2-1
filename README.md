# part2 write-up by Myles Austin

# As starting code, the program seems feasible, but unorthodox. I feel that it could be structured a bit better, and use more straight-forward functions, but I can see what you were going for.

# Task A worked for the most part, except for recognizing tabs. However, the functions used are unfamiliar to me, so I added in an alternate approach.

# Task B was commented out, but seems almost complete. The only issue that I saw was the code ignoring the last character in the line.


#As for things that I've added separately, I added in the file-reading functionality, using fstream.
